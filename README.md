## MelanomaDetection

Welcome to MelanomaDetect, a pet project aimed at image recognition. In this project, I am developing a model to classify images into those containing malignant tumors (melanoma) and those that do not.

### Current Status:
This project is a work in progress. As of now, the model is under development and not finalized.

### Data Source:
The data for this project has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhaveshmittal/melanoma-cancer-dataset).

Stay tuned for updates and progress!
